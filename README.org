** Hello World
*** Port
 - On my Mac, _avrdude_ cannot determine the port to connect to.. it just shows up as
   "unknown". One hack I found is looking it up under /dev/tty.usb* and passing it in
   explicitly. I hid this hack in the Makefile.
- This hack will only work if there's only one USB port in use.. need to find a better
  solution.
